# The-Gellun
The Alternate Physics of an Imaginary Universe

Some Unity Game Engine - and Github - practice while thinking about current issues in Physics. MADE WITH UNITY. And a  simple model.
Android Apk build. 

-----------------------------------------------
Actually that Unity model is a bodego, hiding the true purpose of this repo, that is revealing my model of everything, in the other readme file.
I'm delaying posting Folio Two  or at least a furthur update till July 1, 2023. Had some diversions and some exciting insights that to stew. Open to discussions or even encouragememnt.
